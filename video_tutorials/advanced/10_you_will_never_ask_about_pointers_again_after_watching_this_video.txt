Since you might want to program some things in C++ later on,
it is good to know what pointers are and how they work.

This basic example is not that useful, but makes it clear on how it works.

In actual programs pointers are usually used for objects of classes or arrays.
Because the class object might be stored at some point in the memory and then it will start from the pointers address.
So all values are related to this pointer address and can actually be added, when you wrote typical code.

int *pStudent = &student;
pStudent->getName();

Usually you would write
student.getName();

It is a little weird in the beginning, but some IDEs do a great job on helping out with these as well.
