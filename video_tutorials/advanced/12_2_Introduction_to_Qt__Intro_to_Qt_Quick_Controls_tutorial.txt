This is the second video about QML files.
Don't get confused, but there is a difference in usage here.
In the previous one it was mainly used for GUI style and definition,
but in this one they will actually be used as full applications (code + GUI).

This is referred to as Qt Quick or Qt Quick Controls.

A more flexible and maybe easier way of making things in the long run.
