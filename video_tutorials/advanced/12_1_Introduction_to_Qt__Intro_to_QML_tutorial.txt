In case you already watched some of the QML tutorial playlists, this will probably not be that interesting anymore.
You should watch this probably before you watch these to get a quick insight on the topic.
Like an overview in a fast way.

Later you could watch these playlists to get more details and insight etc.

By the way, this tutorial seems to come from the official "Qt" channel, so they should know what they are doing. :D
They should know...

Random Comment:
I liked how he added a rectangle, named it button and then made a circle out of it.
Just magic. :P

Well, the names and possibilities with QML Elements can be a little confusing.
Especially when you can mix them all together and so on.

For example the MouseArea,
you can add it to any Element and then make it behave like a button.
But then there are several types of Button Elements as well. :D
Just confusing at times, but it will get more useful later on, I promise.
