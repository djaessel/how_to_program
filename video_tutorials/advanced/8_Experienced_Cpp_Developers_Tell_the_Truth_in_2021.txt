This is more of an informative video about the C++ programming language and
where was and might still gets used.

Also it might give you an idea about the job market.

But while it is a fairly old language and its parent language C even around 50 years,
there is still a lot of room for C++ to be used.

So it might be worth looking into it, even if you later might not use it that much,
or maybe not at all.
