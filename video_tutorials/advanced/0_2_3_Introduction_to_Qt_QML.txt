And another one...

Well, you can't have enough tutorials, am I b...right?

Jokes aside, this is just an additional tutorial series for Qt and QML.

Once you finished at least one of the previous tutorial series about this,
you might want to skip some of the videos with similar topics.

But it could be that here and there are videos with new information or different examples.

I think this one is more advanced than the others, but I haven't watched it.
Just from the topics and the looks of it I thought this way.

So I would say this one has probably more details on some topics,
but it is not necessary to start working with Qt and QML files.

Maybe later on you can revisit once you got some experience and see what else you might want to do or could do.
