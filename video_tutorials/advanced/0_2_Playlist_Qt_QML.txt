Here is a video how Qt and the related QML basically work.
This comes in handy with the Python and Pyside/PyQt way as well, since QML stays the same for that.
And you surely will use QML for the GUI either way.

Maybe you should watch this series before you watch the Python version,
but the order is not that important. In the end you should have seen both anyway.

What is important thou, that in the tutorial of PySide they use an .ui file.
This is the usual way of doing things with Qt and widgets.

But there also is something like Qt Quick Applications.
These might look a little different by default and are more cross-platform than the ui thing.
So you will probably use QML for python as well, when creating a gui app.
But it is good to see both things and maybe what their advantages and disadvantages are.

I usually go for QML files since they are easier to understand and edit,
at least from my perspective.

An example:
Then Warband openBrf tool is written in Qt and C++.
That thing uses ui files, which is totally fine since it is usually used on Windows.
(Linux would probably work as well and other operating systems, but when it comes to Android and alike it might not work.)
