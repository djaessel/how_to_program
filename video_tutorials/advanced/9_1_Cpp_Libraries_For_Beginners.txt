Here you can see how C++ handles external code, that someone else has written.
Or maybe code that you have written some time ago and just want to reuse in other projects.

--

Either way it is useful to understand how this works, since a lot of code is based around this.
Even Python at its core and you can also use .DLL or .SO (shared libraries) in Python.

This is not always possible, but can come in handy when it is possible.
Since the code in the shared library should run much faster.

In Python the modules you can import act similar to the C++ include imports,
but there are some differences.
Normally in the header files of C/C++ you only find declarations and abstract code,
which only tells the using code what it can use and how it looks.

It is possible to write actual code in there as well, but it is not recommended.
