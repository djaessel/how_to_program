In this video you will get to know why Python is slower than other programming languages.
Not always, but in general it is the case.

There is also some information about why it is difficult to make out what Python does,
when it comes to foreseeing the runtime behavior.

And other languages often know exactly what happens when and with what.
But there will happen errors as well, of course. :)

Since you have watched the videos about Cython and compiling Python code,
the speed part might change a bit or a lot.

But still there is the part about the variable types and checking,
which is not so much the case in other languages like C/C++, C#, Java or the like.
