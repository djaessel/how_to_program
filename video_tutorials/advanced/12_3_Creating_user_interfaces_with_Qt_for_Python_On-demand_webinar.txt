And finally the official video about how Qt and Python (can) work together.

(Again from the official Qt channel.)

Since you will probably first want to check things out through Python instead of C++.
But later on I would recommend to use poth, just to get familiar with both of them.

In the end it could be that you mainly write your logic inside QML files anyway,
but the more you know the better, I would say.

At least then you can be more flexible and don't have to worry about things like:
 - How am I going to make sure the Client has Python and the correct version?
 - The needed packages are not included by default, how do I do this?
 - How can I port this to C++ to make it just run?
 - Where is my Pony?

Just basic questions you have in life, I guess. :D
