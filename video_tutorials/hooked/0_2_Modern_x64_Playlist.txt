This might be helpful for Assembly Code Tasks or in general.
So basically to getting to know your computer better.

Sometimes there are references to x86 Assembly,
but x64 is basically the some, just with more instructions and registers.

It is important to notice, that x86 can run on 32 Bit and 64 Bit machines,
while x64 can only run on 64 Bit machines, as far as I know.
(At least natively.)

This is mainly for computer programming and specificly for the CPU.
For boards there are sometimes other instructions, registers, etc.
So be aware of that some things can change depending on the architecture.
Or sometimes the compiler (and or operating system) can also make a difference.

But the "plain" Assembly stays mostly the same.
Things like MOV, PUSH, and such.
Just special instructions might change and registers and such.
