This is simply so you have seen it.
And maybe you got a few things sorted or cleared out through this.

You probably never going to use this, especially with Python.
But should you maybe want to investigate this further, it might be interesting.

The Creel channel is more about hardware related functions and code.
For example he compared execution time of CPUs with specific instructions and his own program.

Such things...

But if this was too much for you, simply forget about it (for now). :D
