Here you will get a similar Tutorial Playlist like the beginner Video(s) for Python, just in C++.

It is always good to learn more than one language and I think, learning Python and C++ aside,
will give you enourmous insight into programming and what the CPU does and such things.

Later on you can still decide to use another language or whatsoever, but these seem to be the very best to begin with.

Best practice would probably be to first try to write a program in Python to (just) solve the problem.
Then try to solve the same problem in C++, to understand how it is done in a more "proper" way.
In the end you will understand both languages better and better and also be able to solve things in mutliple ways.
Awesome, isn't it. :)
