Here just an explanation about what Python is common for and why it is better
to also learn other languages instead or later on.

Since the actual market for Python is mostly small or very specific.
Other languages like C/C++, Java, C#, PHP and such are more common and more widely used.

So consider to learn one of these, depending on what your goals might be.

I would consider C++ which is the "better" version of C and capable of a lot of things.
But when it comes to Websites PHP might be better.
And when it comes to Windows Forms Programs (the typical program with graphical user interface) - C# (mostly Windows) or Java.

But there are also a lot of libraries for C++ nowadays, so you could also use Qt for example.
I might use that in some of the tutorials and tasks for you later on.

It really depends on the goal at times, since you can do many things with a lot of languages,
but some are just a bit better in some topic or where actually designed and created for a certain problem and topic.
