# Programming: (Hopefully) All you need to know

Here are some videos to enter programming.  
Hier gibt es Videos zum Einstieg fürs Programmieren.  

As well as some videos about basic functionality of computers.  
Außerdem noch Videos über die Grundfunktionsweise von Computern.  

And at last there are also some videos about Linux and why you should use it. :)
Und schließlich auch noch ein paar Videos über Linux und warum man es benutzen sollte. :)  

# How to handle the practicing tasks

## Terminal Version

Simply start the `start.bat` or `start.sh` file.  

This should start the main terminal program and otherwise give you some information about how to make it run.

### Advanced way to start the program  
  
There are serveral tasks you can practice with.  
To access them properly run the following command inside this folder in terminal:

`python course_program/start.py`  

> In case python3 is not the default the program will inform you

* You will be prompted for a level.  
* Select "Beginner" and then "Standard".

> If you want to start directly as beginner, execute the following  
> `python course_program/start.py --mode=beginner --info-level=standard`  
> or like this:  
> `python course_program/start.py -m=beginner -i=standard`  

This ensures that you only get the beginner tasks with standard info  
Later on you can also access more advanced tasks or advanced info for beginner tasks  

> You can access all tutorials as well as practicing tasks through this program!  

## GUI Version

Simply start the `startGUI.bat` or `startGUI.sh` file.

This should start the main terminal program and otherwise give you some information about how to make it run.

> The GUI version is still work in progress and does nothing at the moment.  
> Which does not mean that it isn't work a quick look ;)  

### Advanced way to start the program  

There are serveral tasks you can practice with.
To access them properly run the following command inside this folder in terminal:

`python how_to_program_app/startGUI.py`

> In case python3 is not the default the program will inform you
  
> More info will be added in the future
