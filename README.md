# Programming: (Hopefully) All you need to know

Here you will learn how to program.  
Besides that you will get information about how computers work in general.  
And there are also some strong hints towards Linux operating systems.  

Be sure to use the related program down below.  
There are two versions available, take the one that suits you best.  

> It might be best to use the GUI version  
> But this version is currently still in the development progress  

## Topics you might get in touch with

> Of course depending on your interest, time and understanding of all this

### Programming and Script Languages

- Python 3.6+
- C/C++
- QML (& JavaScript)
- HTML & CSS
- Assembly (x86/x64 and basic understanding)
- (...)

### Things you will learn and practice

- Mainly learning to program with Python
- Commandline programs
- GUI applications
- Code Simulators
  > Using and handling custom programming languages
- Problems solving 
  > Not only writing new programs  
  - Examples:
    - Fix an existing program
    - Find a virus
    - Develop datastructure
    - Debug code
    - ...
- Linux OS:
  - Mainly Debian/Ubuntu based
  - Basic commands
  - File System
  - Package management and creation
- VirtualBox `Basic Example`
- Databases:
  - MySQL/MariaDB
  - ODBC
    > A generalized connection method
  - (SQLServer)
- Hardware near programming:
  - You will read and use some Assembly code
  - Understand how a CPU actually operates
  - DataTypes at low-level compared with high-level languages
  - Little Hacks and Mind puzzles
- Connecting different programming languages
  - Using Dynamic libraries (for example in Python)
  - Writing optimized code in different languages
  - Comapring speed and pros/cons
- Differences Scripting/Interpreter and "actual" programming languages
  - Pros/Cons
  - Possibilites to convert between of them
- ... [and much much more :)]


# Programming learning program

<details><summary><h2>Terminal Version [CLICK]</h2></summary>
<p>

## Terminal Version

Simply start the `start.bat` or `start.sh` file.  

This should start the main terminal program and otherwise give you some information about how to make it run.

### Advanced way to start the program  
  
There are serveral tasks you can practice with.  
To access them properly run the following command inside this folder in terminal:

```bash
python course_program/start.py
```

> In case python3 is not the default the program will inform you

* You will be prompted for a level.  
* Select "Beginner" and then "Standard".

> If you want to start directly as beginner, execute the following  
```bash
python course_program/start.py --mode=beginner --info-level=standard
```  
> or like this:  
```bash
python course_program/start.py -m=beginner -i=standard`
```  

This ensures that you only get the beginner tasks with standard info  
Later on you can also access more advanced tasks or advanced info for beginner tasks  

> You can access all tutorials as well as practicing tasks through this program!

<details><summary><h2>GUI Version [CLICK]</h2></summary>
<p>

## GUI Version

Simply start the `startGUI.bat` or `startGUI.sh` file.

This should start the main terminal program and otherwise give you some information about how to make it run.

> The GUI version is still work in progress and does nothing at the moment.  
> Which does not mean that it isn't worth a quick look :)  

### Advanced way to start the program  

There are serveral tasks you can practice with.  
To access them properly run the following command inside this folder in terminal:  

```bash  
python how_to_program_app/startGUI.py`
```

> In case python3 is not the default the program will inform you  
> More info will be added in the future
