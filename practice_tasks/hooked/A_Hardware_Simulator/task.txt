You are working for a hardware engineering company.
Recently some new hardware was developed.

The new and shiny Ceplox-ICA-224 processing unit.

Your task is to write a program that can simulate the assembly code written for this new hardware.

For more information about the hardware, take a look at the "manual.pdf" or "manual.txt" files.

The related hardware engineer gave you an example:

Example:
  Assembly Instruction:
   ("MOV", "AX", 0x1234)
  Pseudo code for simulation:
   # Registers
   variable AX = 0 
   ...
   variable current_asm_instruction = ("MOV", "AX", 0x1234)
   simulate_asm_code(current_asm_instruction)
   ...
   show_all_registers()
  Output:
   Register | HEX-Value | Int-Value
   AX       | 0x1234    | 4660
   ...


Add all registers.
Make your code handle all assembly instructions properly.

The engineer added, that she needs to see whether a text character is equal to a registers value.
Valid characters:
  ","
  "."
  " "
  "0" - "9"
  "a" - "z"
  "A" - "Z"

In case the value of the register is not one of these characters show "???" instead.

Example output:
   Register | HEX-Value | Int-Value | Char-Value
   AX       | 0x0041    | 65        | 'A'
   BX       | 0x1234    | 4660      | ???
   ...
