Today your task is to create a guesser.

But not your typical guessing for numbers.
Make a guesser for letters.

The goal is to have a program that asks a few questions.

Questions like:
 - Comes your letter before the guessed one?
 - Does your letter come after my guess?

And then the user should enter "yes" or "no" (well or just the first letter of these).

In the end the program should guess the correct letter/character.

Allowed are a-z and A-Z


Bonus:

Now that you got it working, why not add another feature.
Make the program able to both guess a number and a letter.

Let the guessing limits be 0 - 100 (including) for the numbers.
