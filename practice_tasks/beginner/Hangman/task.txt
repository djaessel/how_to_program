You might know the game about guessing a name, right?

Like from school maybe?

Someone draws some lines on the board and then people can say letters.
Each time a the letter is in the word, the letter will be put on to the lines.
All occurrences of this letter.

But when the letter was not in the word, a hangman would get another line drawn.
For each wrong letter another line until the hangman is done.

If someone guessed the word and or all letters included were said, the game is won.
If the hangman is complete, the game is lost.
Either way it is over.

For the start you got a little list with words to randomly choose from.
You can add or use your own words if you like.
But all of these should be lower case (for now).

Spaces should be ignored for the guessing, but recognized.

Example BEGIN

Guess: 
       _ _ _ _

Hangman:


Say a letter: a

Guess:   a
       _ _ _ _

Hangman:


Say a letter: i

Guess:   a   i
       _ _ _ _

Hangman:


Say a letter: e

Guess:   a   i
       _ _ _ _

Hangman:







  _______

Example END


The final result would be:

Guess: t a x i
       _ _ _ _

The final Hangman would be:
      _______
     |/      |
     |      (_)
     |      \|/
     |       |
     |      / \
     |
