Create a 2D shooter game with invasions.

You should have a player character on the left side with a HP bar or just some info about the HP.
There also should be a bullet element visible, as if the player shoots from the left to the right.

Then there shall be a few enemies with HP bars or just some info as well, who approach the player from the right.

When an enemy reaches the player, the player loses HP points.
Once the player has no HP points left, the game is lost.
So print such a message to show it is over and stop the ability to shoot.


Hint: Use Qt Animations for this.
Hint: Use C++ and QML (with focus on QML for easier use)


Bonus:

Add a new enemy type that moves up and down, so the player has to actually aim a little.
Set the aiming range in between a 30Â° angle, if possible.

Make the enemy as if it flies and when it got hit, make it fall down.


Extra Bonus:

Add a second wave with more enemies.
If you have fun, add another wave, basically implementing a wave system here.

At the end of each round say that it is over.

From here on, have fun and do whatever you want with the game,
well... or nothing, since it was just a practice for you.
