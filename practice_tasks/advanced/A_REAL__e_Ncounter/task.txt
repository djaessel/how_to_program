Standard:

You just woke up and decided: "Today I want to create my first python GUI!"
Yay!

And so you ask some friends what you could program.

The best what they came up with was a clicker program.

You basically click on a button and then a points value gets increased by 1.

Then someone thought, well maybe add a few more buttons.
You can't have enough of those, right?

The second button should be available after you reached 50 points.

50 clicks bro...

And then you would loose 50 points.

The second button would add 10 points per click.

The thirds activates after 250 points.
And it can add 50 points per click.

I think you see where this is going.

At first these three buttons are enough.
But if you want you can add more of course.

(Hints: Qt GUI, Pyside2 or Pyside6, PyQt5 / PyQt6, Qt QML, ...)


Bonus:

Now that you have at least three buttons,
we can add a new feature!

Awesome! (Okay, why am I writing like this? Anyway...)

After you enabled all buttons (so at least the three or all you added after that),
there should be the option to buy an autoclicker for each of the buttons.
The price would be: initial_point_price_to_enable * 5
The first button has 1 for this value, so it would be 5 points for the autoclicker.
The second button would be 50 * 5 = 250
Third button would be 250 * 5 = 1250
and so on...

Maybe make a different window and or menu for that.

The autoclicker should add the value of the buttons click every 5 seconds.
Make sure to set that up correct.
You can update all buttons in one go if you want.


Extra Bonus:
