Standard:

You just woke up and decided: "Today I want to create my first python GUI!"
Yay!

And so you ask some friends what you could program.

The best what they came up with was a clicker program.

You basically click on a button and then a points value gets increased by 1.

Then someone thought, well maybe add a few more buttons.
You can't have enough of those, right?

The second button should be available after you reached 50 points.

50 clicks bro...

And then you would loose 50 points.

The second button would add 10 points per click.

The thirds activates after 250 points.
And it can add 50 points per click.

I think you see where this is going.

At first these three buttons are enough.
But if you want you can add more of course.

(Hints: Qt GUI, Pyside2 or Pyside6, PyQt5 / PyQt6, Qt QML, ...)
(Hint: QmlDesigner - https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-qtquickdesigner-plugin.html)
(Hint: It is possible that you can't use the Designer properly with Qt for Python, 
 simply create an empty Qt C++ project and try to use the QML Designer there. 
 It should work. Later simply move the QML to the Python project and all should run properly.)


Bonus:

Now that you have at least three buttons,
we can add a new feature!

Awesome! (Okay, why am I writing like this? Anyway...)

After you enabled all buttons (so at least the three or all you added after that),
there should be the option to buy an autoclicker for each of the buttons.
The price would be: initial_point_price_to_enable * 5
The first button has 1 for this value, so it would be 5 points for the autoclicker.
The second button would be 50 * 5 = 250
Third button would be 250 * 5 = 1250
and so on...

Maybe make a different window and or menu for that.

The autoclicker should add the value of the buttons click by some duration in seconds.
For the first 100 milliseconds.
For the second 1.5 seconds.
For the third 2 seconds.
...

Make sure to set that up correct.
You can update all buttons in one go if you want.


Extra Bonus:

Now that you got yourself a little clicker game,
how about adding something to save the current points.
Then you could save them on exit and reload them when starting again.
So you keep all the points for the next run.

The same goes for the autoclickers, whether they were activated or not.

Great, isn't it?! :P

Another thing would be to add achievements.
Something you can unlock after you reach a certain amount of points.

How about the following:

Points	| Message / Name
1337	| "One Liter of wine.exe"
2500	| "A well planned investment"
5000	| "5 bucks, please, kay?"
6789	| "You got a road!"
10000	| "Millionare in cents"
28689	| "Nice!"
43605	| "MAGIC NUMBER"
49178	| "Want some coke?"
57005	| "You are DEAD"
100000  | "Are you alright?"
1000000 | "Millionare for real!"
1234567 | "Joking around"
9999999 | "OVER 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 THOUSAND!"


You can of course use your own, as always, but some of these have a "secret" message. :D
